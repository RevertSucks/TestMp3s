# How To Use  
as long as you have write/readfile this should work
but first get the loadstring
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RevertSucks/TestMp3s/main/main.lua"))()
```
now set a _G. value above that
```lua
_G.providedurl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RevertSucks/TestMp3s/main/Songs/UGK.mp3"
```
and it should now look like this
```lua
_G.providedurl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RevertSucks/TestMp3s/main/Songs/UGK.mp3"
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RevertSucks/TestMp3s/main/main.lua"))()
```
and thats it! execute. if you want to change the song all you have to do is go to the songs folder click a song, and right click open raw and copy link. will soon provide video for help
